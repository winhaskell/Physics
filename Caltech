About
The faculty, staff scientists, and students in the Division of Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy (PMA) create and use the most
ambitious and technologically advanced tools in their efforts to explore and understand all aspects of our universe—from its 
structure to its symmetries, from its birth to its future. Their research covers all scales, from the cosmos down to atoms, 
electrons, strings, quantum foam, and more.

The division encourages the kind of high-risk, high-reward work that sets it apart. It does this by investing in exceptional
experimental facilities and fostering a collaborative and interdisciplinary atmosphere in which science's best minds can be set 
to work on its most intractable—and fascinating—problems.

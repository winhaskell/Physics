 The Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences is a national and international visitor research institute. 
 It runs research programmes on selected themes in mathematics and the mathematical sciences with applications over 
 a wide range of science and technology. It attracts leading mathematical scientists from the UK and overseas to interact 
 in research over an extended period.

INI has a vital national role, building on many strengths that already exist in UK universities, aiming to generate a new 
vitality through stimulating and nurturing research throughout the country.

During each scientific programme new collaborations are made and ideas and expertise are exchanged and catalysed through lectures, 
seminars and informal interaction, which the INI building has been designed specifically to encourage.

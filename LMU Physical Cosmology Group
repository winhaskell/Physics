Physical Cosmology Group

We are located at the University Observatory Munich (USM). We work on the interface between theoretical and observational cosmology. 
Our main research interest is in confronting modern cosmological theories with observations. Here we have in particular a strong 
research program in exploiting galaxy clusters and cosmic voids, but also in more general probes of the large-scale structure and
the cosmic microwave back ground. One of our main motivations is to understand the nature of the cosmic acceleration in the Universe. 
Here we try to constrain theoretical models from standard dark energy, coupled scalar fields to theories which extend Einstein's gravity
at large distances. In order to achieve this goal we use analytical and numerical methods, such as N-body simulations of the structure
formation process, state of the art statistical analysis tools and modern Bayesian techniques. Furthermore we have a strong research
program in machine learning applications in astrophysics, but also apply these methods in medical physics and string theory.

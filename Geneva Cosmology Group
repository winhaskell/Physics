Geneva Cosmology Group

https://cosmology.unige.ch

We are a group of physicists working on theoretical cosmology, the theory of the geometry, structure and evolution of the Universe 
as a whole. The big bang is thought of as the birth of the Universe as we know it and sets the stage for its further evolution.

The Geneva Cosmology Group is a part of the Department of Theoretical Physics of the University of Geneva (Switzerland) and is 
also a member of the Centre for Astroparticle Physics (CAP) Gen√®ve. The senior members of the group are currently Camille Bonvin,
Ruth Durrer, Stefano Foffa, Martin Kunz, Michele Maggiore and Toni Riotto.

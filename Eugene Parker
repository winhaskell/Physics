Eugene Parker

Eugene Newman Parker (June 10, 1927 â€“ March 15, 2022) was an American solar and plasma physicist. 
In the 1950s he proposed the existence of the solar wind and that the magnetic field in the outer Solar System 
would be in the shape of a Parker spiral, predictions that were later confirmed by spacecraft measurements. 
In 1987, Parker proposed the existence of nanoflares, a leading candidate to explain the coronal heating problem.

Parker obtained his PhD from Caltech and spent four years as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Utah. 
He joined University of Chicago in 1955 and spent the rest of his career there, holding positions in the physics department,
the astronomy and astrophysics department, and the Enrico Fermi Institute. Parker was elected to the National Academy 
of Sciences in 1967. In 2017, NASA named its Parker Solar Probe in his honor, the first NASA spacecraft named after a living person

In the mid-1950s, Parker developed the theory of supersonic solar wind and predicted the Parker spiral shape of the
solar magnetic field in the outer Solar System. His theoretical modeling was not immediately accepted by the astronomical community: 
when he submitted the results to The Astrophysical Journal, two reviewers recommended its rejection. The editor of the journal,
Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, overruled the reviewers and published the paper anyway. Parker's theoretical predictions were confirmed
by satellite observations a few years later, especially the 1962 Mariner 2 mission.

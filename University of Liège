The AGO Department includes about one hundred researchers in Astrophysics, Geophysics and Oceanography. 
The interests are multiple : monitoring and analysis of climate and oceans, study of planets and small bodies 
in our solar system and other planetary systems, modeling and observations of stars in our Galaxy, 
analysis of galactic and extragalactic structures such as quasars... not to mention cosmology and the
study of fundamental particles. Tools useful for this research are developed, often in close collaboration 
with the "Centre Spatial de Liège". The AGO department actively participates in worldwide projects and 
several of its members play an active role within international bodies.

Knowledge sharing and outreach activities are part of the traditions of the department. On this site you will 
also find educational material, a calendar of upcoming conferences and seminars, as well as the latest news from the Cosmos.

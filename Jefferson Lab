Exploring the Nature of Matter

Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) is a U.S. Department of Energy Office 
of Science national laboratory. Scientists worldwide utilize the labâ€™s unique particle accelerator, 
known as the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF), to probe the most basic building 
blocks of matter - helping us to better understand these particles and the forces that bind them - 
and ultimately our world.

In addition, the lab capitalizes on its unique technologies and expertise to perform advanced computing 
and applied research with industry and university partners, and provides programs designed to help educate
the next generation in science and technology.

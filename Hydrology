Hydrology
https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/environmental-fluid-mechanics-and-hydrology

Environmental fluid mechanics and hydrology deal primarily with the occurrence and movement 
of water and other fluids on the surface of the earth. Civil engineering applications of this discipline
traditionally deal with river engineering, the hydrology of surface drainage and runoff, 
pipelines and conveyance systems, groundwater, flooding and its prevention, coastal processes and 
nearshore oceanography, hydroelectric generation, water supply and distribution, and fluid measurement.

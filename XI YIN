String theory, being our best hope for a complete description of quantum gravity and a unified theory of everything, 
also provides a powerful toolbox along the way for solving problems in seemingly very different subjects, such as strongly 
coupled quantum field theories, conformal field theory, integrable systems, algebraic geometry, hyperbolic geometry, etc.

Xi Yin's research interest lies in the fundamental aspects of string theory, and what string theory can teach us about other 
fields in physics and mathematics.

Small-scale Modeling

http://www.cosmo-model.org/content/default.htm

The Consortium for Small-scale Modeling (COSMO) was formed in October 1998. Its general goal is to develop,
improve and maintain a non-hydrostatic limited-area atmospheric model, to be used both for operational and
for research applications by the members of the consortium. Moreover, within a licence agreement, the COSMO 
model may be used for operational and research applications by other national (hydro-)meteorological services, 
universities and research institutes.

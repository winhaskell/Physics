“Mind-bending…. [An] alternately fascinating and frightening book.” —San Francisco Chronicle
 

Space elevators. Internet-enabled contact lenses. Cars that fly by floating on magnetic fields. 
This is the stuff of science fiction—it’s also daily life in the year 2100.
 

Renowned theoretical physicist Michio Kaku considers how these inventions will affect the world economy, 
addressing the key questions: Who will have jobs? Which nations will prosper? 
Kaku interviews three hundred of the world’s top scientists—working in their labs on astonishing prototypes. 
He also takes into account the rigorous scientific principles that regulate how quickly, how safely, and how far technologies can advance. 
In Physics of the Future, Kaku forecasts a century of earthshaking advances in technology that could make even the last centuries’ leaps and bounds seem insignificant.

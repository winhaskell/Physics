Lectures on Radio Technology, History, and Applications

The 2020 IAP lecture series has concluded. Please see below for recordings of all talks.

Hosted by The MIT Radio Society and EECS. See schedule below for a list of dates and topics. 
All talks take place in MIT room 4-270 and will be livestreamed and recorded.

Have you ever wondered about the underlying principles behind Wi-Fi? How radar works, or how we know so much about the early universe? 
Or even just what those people are doing up on the Green Building roof at such odd hours?

This IAP, the MIT Radio Society (W1MX, MITâ€™s Amateur Radio Club) is hosting a lecture series on everything radio. 
Each talk will be a self-contained window into a different facet of radio, ranging from radar techniques, interferometry, 
imaging and radioastronomy, to the design of antennas and modern chip scale RF devices. No prior experience with radio
is necessary or expected and all are welcome. Feel free to attend individual lectures, or better yet come to all of them!
